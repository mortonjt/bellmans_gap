## librna/vienna ##

The source files under librna/vienna (energy parameters, tables and a parameter
file loading routine) are copied from the ViennaRNA 2 package
(http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/). The ViennaRNA package itself is
distributed under a custom open source license (it is also available under
librna/vienna/COPYING). See also each source file librna/vienna for special
copyright and citation notes. It is not really clear if the Vienna-License is
applicable to all files under librna/vienna - perhaps it does not cover
automatically generated parameter files (i.e. *.par and source code).

The object files under librna/vienna are linked into librna.so.
